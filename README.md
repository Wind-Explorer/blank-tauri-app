# Tauri + React + Vite + Typescript + TailwindCSS + NextUI + React Router DOM

Adam's custom tauri app template for rapid prototyping

Uses Tauri 2.0 RC.
- Light / Dark mode support
- Routing support
- Window resize optimization

All that needs to be done is to hit `Cmd` + `Shift` + `H` to replace all occurances of `blank-tauri-app` with a custom app name.
